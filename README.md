# Cl4ssB4ttle

RPG Battle Terminal Minigame coded in C++

This version has been developped before I finished the CPP Piscine at 42 Lausanne and therefore will probably be updated.

At this day, 3 classes have been implemented: Shadow, Berserk and Guardian.
Each class has one active skill and two passive skills.

## Shadow
### Active Skill: Hide
### Passive Skill (1): Sneak Attack
### Passive Skill (2): Bleeding Strike
## Berserk
### Active Skill: Headbutt
### Passive Skill (1): Rage
### Passive Skill (2): Thick Skin
## Guardian
### Active Skill: Guard
### Passive Skill (1): Counter
### Passive Skill (2): Peaceful Aura
